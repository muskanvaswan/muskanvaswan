# Introduction
Hi I'm Muskan Vaswan.
I'm an 18 year old,
freshman in College,
Pursuing a Bachelor's in Technology, for Computer Science.

More Importantly: I'm a Self Taught, web developer and have been one for around an year.

However, I have been into coding since I was much younger, so there is the occasional appearance of algorithms, AI on my profile too. I also love C++, but mostly end up working with Python


# Languages and Frameworks
